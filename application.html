      <p>Currently, some students who study IT still confuse the concept of website and web app, have a friend to ask, so I write this article by the way.</p>

<p>This is a question "easy to think but not easy", because the boundary between website and webapp is quite fragile. I have to synthesize a lot of answers from stackoverflow and programmers.stackexchange to give me the most "approximate" answer.</p>
<h1>Web Site and Web Appp definition</h1>
  <p>WEBSITE: A long time ago,when the Internet was rudimentary, the web was written in single html. Every single website is written in html called Web Page. Gather multiple individual websites, into one large website, with the same domain name, called Website.</p>
  <P>WEBAPP: Understandably, web apps are web-based applications. Through the web app, users can perform a number of tasks: calculating, sharing images, shopping ... The interactive nature of the web app is much higher than the website.</p>

<p>For some people who are not knowledgeable about IT, all things online, accessible by browser are websites. So they often ask you: supermarket management website, sales website, ... they are all webapps.</p>

    <caption>Different Between Web App And Web Site</caption>
    <tr>
      <th>Web Site</th>
      <th>Web App</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Low interaction, low functionality (See, read, click back and forth between links ...)</td>
      <td>High interaction, multiple functions (Post information, upload files, export reports ...)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Made up of static html pages and some resources (images, audio, video)</td>
      <td>Created by html and back end code (PHP, C #, Java, ...)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Used to store and display information</td>
      <td>Used to "perform a task", perform the functions of an application</td>
    </tr>

<h1>Compare website and web app</h1>
<p>In fact, the boundary between web app and website is quite fragile. An online newspaper - vnexpress, for example, in the eyes of readers it is a website. But in the eyes of the editor or admin, it is the web app. Some websites allow users to search and comment but it is still a website, not a webapp. Below is a comparison table (relative).</p>
