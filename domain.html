  <h1>What is domain?</h1>
  <p>  Domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit your website.</P>

<p>In simple terms, if your website was a house, then your domain name will be its address.</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation:</p>

<p>The Internet is a giant network of computers connected to each other through a global network of cables. Each computer on this network can communicate with other computers.</p>

<p>To identify them, each computer is assigned an IP address. It is a series of numbers that identify a particular computer on the internet. A typical IP address looks like this: 66.249.66.1</p>

<p>Now an IP address like this is quite difficult to remember. Imagine if you had to use such numbers to visit your favorite websites.</p>

<p>Domain names were invented to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Now if you want to visit a website, then you don’t need to enter a long string of numbers. Instead, you can visit it by typing an easy to remember domain name in your browser’s address bar. For example, youtube.com.</p>

<h1>How Domain Names Actually Work?</h1>
<p>When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>

<p>These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the domain and forward the request to those name servers.</p>
<p>These name servers are computers managed by your hosting company. Your hosting company will forward your request to the computer where your website is stored.</p>

<p>This computer is called a web server. It has special software installed (Apache, Nginx are two popular web server software). The web server now fetches the web page and pieces of information associated with it.</p>

<p>Finally, it then sends this data back to the browser.</p>
<h1>Different Types of Domain Names</h1>
<p>Domain names are available in many different extensions. The most popular one is .com. There are many other options like .org, .net, .tv, .info, .io, and more. However we always recommend using .com domain extension.</p>

<p>Let’s take a more detailed look at different types of domain names available.</p>
<h2>Top Level Domain – TLD</h2>
<p>Top level domain or TLD are generic domain extensions that are listed at the highest level in the domain name system.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of TLDs, but the most popular ones are .com, .org, and .net. Other TLDs are lesser known and we don’t recommend using them. For example, .biz, .club, .info, .agency, and many more.</p>

<h2>Country Code Top Level Domain – ccTLD</h2>

<p>Country code top-level domain or ccTLD are country specific domain names which end with country code extension like .uk for the United Kingdom, .de for Germany, .in for India.</p>

<p>They are used by websites that want to target audiences in a specific country.</p>

<h2>Sponsored Top Level Domain – sTLD</h2>

<p>Sponsored top-level domain or sTLD is a category of TLDs that has a sponsor representing a specific community served by the domain extension.</p>

<p>For example, .edu for education-related organizations, .gov for the United States government, .mil for the United States military, and more.</p>
