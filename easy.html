      <h1>Easy Steps To Create A Website</h1>
      <p>A few decades ago building a site was a rather challenging task, yet today creating a blog, online store, photo album or a forum is easier than ever. In this brief tutorial we will describe the most essential steps to create a website for you to realize there is nothing daunting about launching your own site.</p>
<h1>Step 1: Domain Name</h1>

<p>Picking effective domain name (also known as web address or URL) is important for a lot of reasons. Try to come up with such a name that will clearly reflect the essence of your site: what kind of business you run or what service you offer.</p>
<p>Domain name must be something people can easily recall and are unlikely to misspell. You may be surprised to learn that obtaining one can cost you nothing: you will easily find websites offering domain names for free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the effective one-word domains are already occupied, yet you may try to buy a desired one from its owner at a steep price. Because of the speculators who buy many names and then resell those at exorbitant prices we recommend you add a few short words detailing the site main goal or indicating your geographical locale.</p><br><br>

<h1>Step 2: Hosting</h1>

<p>You may pick domain name and host your website with one company. Or you may also shop around in order to select the best offers on domain name registration and hosting service separately.</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting company investigate the most important characteristics such as connection speed, limits on bandwidth and hits etc.</p>
<p>If you select a paid hosting make sure you will not be charged much in case of high traffic going through your site. Look for reasonable prices, tried-and-true companies and positive customers feedback.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>Step 3: CMS</h1>

<p>The aforementioned steps are the inevitable actions you need to take if you decide to build up a site by yourself. For many this experience can turn into a rather challenging and sometimes pretty expensive task.</p>
