        <p>Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their website. It’s practically essential after all: one design for the BlackBerry, another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must be compatible, too. </p><br>
        <p>In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop? It won’t, of course. In the field of Web design and development, we’re quickly getting to the point of being unable to keep up with the endless new resolutions and devices.</P><br>
        <p>For many websites, creating a website version for each resolution and new device would be impossible, or at least impractical. Should we just suffer the consequences of losing visitors from one device, for the benefit of gaining visitors from another? Or is there another option?</P> <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.</p><br>
        <p>As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.</p><br>
        <h1>What is Responsive Web Design?</h1><br>
        <p>Responsive Web Design is the way you build a responsive website on each device and different frame sizes, regardless of the large, small frame or computer (desktop). With this method, the user experience on each device will increase markedly. For example, on the frame of the phone, everything is still displayed clearly, fully and more subtly.</p><br>
        <p>The concept of Responsive Web Design is given by Ethan Marcotte in "Responsive Web Design" book . You should read to have a more comprehensive and insightful look.</p><br>
        <h1>Differentiate Responsive Web Design and Adapt Mobile</h1>
        <p>Although both Responsive Web Design and Mobile Adaptive (Adaptive Mobile) have a similar way of handling, and changing the website layout at a certain time frame size, they still have differences .</p><br>
        <p>Responsive is understood to quickly change and fit most changes, while Adaptive means easy to modify for specific purposes and situations.</p><br>
        <p>Responsive can work and update layout continuously, such as when window length and width change, while Adaptive will only change on predefined element groups, for example, 480px frame, 1024px frame .</p><br>
