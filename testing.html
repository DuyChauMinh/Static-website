        <h1>What is the meaning of 'Software Testing'</h1>
        <p>Definition: The process or method of finding error/s in a software application or program so that the application functions according to the end user's requirement is called software testing.</p>
        <p>Description: Software testing is the process of verifying a system with the purpose of identifying any errors, gaps or missing requirement versus the actual requirement. Software testing is broadly categorised into two types - functional testing and non-functional testing.</p>

<p>When to start test activities: Testing should be started as early as possible to reduce the cost and time to rework and produce software that is bug-free so that it can be delivered to the client. However, in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), testing can be started from the Requirements Gathering phase and continued till the software is out there in productions. It also depends on the development model that is being used. For example, in the Waterfall model, testing starts from the testing phase which is quite below in the tree,; but in the V-model, testing is performed parallel to the development phase.</p>

<p>When to stop test activities: An application can never be 100% bug-free. So to ascertain when one can stop testing is difficult. However, the following things are kept in mind while stopping the test activities:</p>
<section>
<li>Testing deadlines </li><br>

<li>Completion of test case execution cycle</li><br>

<li>Completion of functional testing and code coverage to an agreed limit</li><br>

<li>No high-priority bug is found and the rate of finding bug declines after a certain level</li><br>

<li>Management decision A software test process consists of the activities listed below:</li><br>
<p>+ Planning and control</p><br>

<p>+ Analysis and design</p><br>

<p>+ Implementation and execution</p><br>

<p>+ Meeting exit criteria</p><br>

<p>+ Test closure activities</p>
</section>
<h1> Automated Testing </h1>
<p>Testing is a very important phase in the development process. It ensures that all the bugs are ironed out and that the product, software or hardware, is functioning as expected or as close to the target performance as possible. Even so, some tasks are too laborious to be done manually even though they are easy enough to do. This is where automated testing comes in. </p>

<p>The key advantages to automated testing include:<p><br>
<section>
<li>Saves time and money by making testing more efficient</li><br>
<li>Improves testing accuracy compared to testing directed by humans</li><br>
<li>Increases test coverage because multiple testing tools can be deployed at once allowing for parallel testing of different test scenarios</li><br>
<li>Helps developers by finding bugs and errors more quickly</li><br>
